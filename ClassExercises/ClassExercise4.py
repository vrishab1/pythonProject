Class: CS230--Section 3
Name: Vrishab Bharti
Description:
Exercise 1: Write a Python function that takes a total taxable purchase as an argument and a default argument of the value of the sales tax. In the function, calculate and return the sales tax amount rounded to decimal places. Use the Massachusetts sales tax rate of 6.25%.
Exercise 2: Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper-case letters and lower-case letters. The running of the script would look as follows:
Exercise 3: Write a function that takes a distance and fuel costs as a required argument and mpg with a default of 50 mpg (functions without these three parameters will not be acceptable solutions!). The program asks the user for the distance and fuel costs and the function should return the cost in dollars. Format the output using f-strings. The output would look like the following:
Exercise 4: Write a function that takes two strings and determines whether they are an anagram. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. Spaces are counted in the phrase. The running of the script would look as follows, meaning pass to the function the two strings in each example (please include these strings in your code so as to eliminate user input):
Exercise 5: You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write a function that computes the result, encoded as an integrer value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. If your speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If your speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 65 higher and you will not get a ticket. The result of the function would be as follows (please include these strings in your code so as to eliminated user input) :
