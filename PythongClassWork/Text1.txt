What is the Python programming language?
Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than is possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming or procedural styles.
It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.
The best way we learn any programming langauge is by practice as programming is not a spectator sport.
