text = """Bentley University is a private university in Waltham, Massachusetts. Founded in 1917 as a school of accounting and finance in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood,
Bentley moved to Waltham in 1968. Bentley awards Bachelor of Science degrees in 14 business fields and Bachelor of Arts degrees in 11 arts and sciences disciplines,
offering 36 minors in arts and science and business disciplines.

Bentley University was founded in 1917 as the Bentley School of Accounting and Finance by Harry C. Bentley, who served as the school's president until 1953. In 1961,
the college was accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Science degrees under President Thomas Lincoln Morison, who moved the college from its Boylston Street address in Boston to its current-day location in Waltham, Massachusetts.
Land for this move was purchased from the Lyman Estate in 1962, and the construction to develop the campus then lasted from 1963 to 1968.[4]

Gregory H. Adamian, a major driving force in the college's development, became the fourth president in 1970. Under his guidance, the college became accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1971 and graduate degrees in 1973. During this time, the school also changed its name to Bentley College. In 2002, Bentley College opened up a campus in the Middle Eastern country of Bahrain in partnership with the Bahrain Institute of Banking and Finance.

The college was accredited to confer its first doctoral degrees in the fields of business and accountancy in 2005.[5] A main fixture of the campus, The Bentley Library, underwent a sweeping renovation in 2006 during which time the school's logo was changed to showcase the clock tower that sits atop the building.[6] One year later, Gloria Cordes Larson, a former state and federal government official and Boston-based lawyer, became the first female president of Bentley College. In 2008, under the leadership of provost Bob Galliers,
the school changed its name to Bentley University after being authorized by the state board of higher education to do so.[7] Alison Davis-Blake, the former dean of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota and of the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, became Bentley's eighth president in July 2018. She stepped down in June 2020 and was replaced by Interim President Paul Condrin, the chair of the board of trustees.[8]

In March 2021, the board unanimously appointed Dr. E. LaBrent Chrite to serve as Bentley's ninth president."""
